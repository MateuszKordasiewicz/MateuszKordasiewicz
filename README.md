ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MateuszKordasiewicz

  I'm fascinated by all sorts of mechanical marvels. 
I have a particular interest in boats, planes and rockets; with a particular passion for engines within these systems.
A book I'm really enjoying going through is Steve Burntons "Data Driven Science and Engineering."
Then on the sidelines I'm working my way through the standard industrial engineering manuals (APQP, FMEA, MSA, PPAP). 


  I'm currently in the works to launch a store to sell my existing projects.
I've also been developing an electric propulsion unit for surfboards, paddleboards and kayaks planning on launching for summer of 2024.
