ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MateuszKordasiewicz

  I'm fascinated by all sorts of mechanical marvels. 
I have a particular interest in boats, planes and rockets; with a particular passion for engines and propulsion systems.
I'm really enjoying Steve Burntons "Data Driven Science and Engineering."
Then for some light reading I'm working my way through the APQP, FMEA, MSA, PPAP manuals. 

I've also been developing an electric propulsion unit for surfboards, paddleboards and kayaks planning on launching for summer of 2024. 

I'm in the works to setup and launch a store to sell some of my existing projects.
